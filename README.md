# Mastermind

# PROBLEM
  Create a Mastermind game where two players are involved where one will have to create a combination of 
	colors where the other player will have to guess untill a certain number of tries.

# STEPS
	1- Create two players (creator and finder)
	2- Guesser should be able to select color combination from a given color
	3- Finder will input their guess
	4- The guess should be comapred and outputed correctly according to the position and matching number of 
	guesses (if position is correct red, if there's a match white.)
